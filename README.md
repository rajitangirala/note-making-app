Note-Making App

This is a simple note-taking app built with Node.js and Express. The app allows users to create, view, and delete notes. The data is stored in a local JSON file (notes.json). The backend provides endpoints for managing notes:

GET /notes: Fetch all notes

POST /notes: Add a new note

DELETE /notes/:id: Delete a note by ID

The app is designed to showcase basic CRUD operations using a Node.js backend and can be integrated with a frontend to interact with these endpoints.
